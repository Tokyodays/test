Hi Jeremy.
I'm sorry to be late. 
Is it posible to plan for Saturday,March 29?
 I want to practice my English language skills.
I can also help your Japanese.

Hello Chie,
It's Jeremy from the international party.  I am 37 from USA and stay in Shinagawa.
I would definitely like to meet you again.  Can we make a plan for this week?

Best wishes
Jeremy
